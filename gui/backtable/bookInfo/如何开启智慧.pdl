#如何开启智慧
@（英）赖特（Wright,A.)（著），梁燕（注）
%How to Improue Your Mind is one in a series of five books. There are five chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of improving your mind. There are several different sections in each chapter, and some will probably be more interesting and relevant to you than others. There is no need to read every section. I hope you will find it all interesting and entertaining, and that your reading of English will improve as well as your abilities.
★Indicates that there is a question you should think about on your own.
★★Indicates that if you are reading the book with another person you should talk about this particular question with him or her.
You may be reading the book while studying English in a class, with a teacher, or you may be reading it at home in the evenings, or on a train, or anywhere else-it doesn't matter!
What I do hope is that you enjoy reading about improving your mindin English!
